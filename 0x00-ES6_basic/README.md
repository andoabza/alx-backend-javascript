## Let and Const

`let` and `const` are new ways to declare variables. `let` is block scoped, and `const` is block scoped and read-only.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a new way to declare functions with a shorter syntax. They also have the benefit of not having their own `this` context.

## Classes

ES6 introduces classes for object-oriented programming. Classes in ES6 are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

## Modules

Modules allow you to split your code into reusable pieces. They can be imported and exported using `import` and `export` keywords.

## Promises

Promises are used for asynchronous programming. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

## Default Parameters

Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters.

## Rest and Spread Operators

The rest operator allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The spread operator allows you to expand iterable objects into multiple elements.

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

## Template Literals

Template literals provide a new way to work with strings. They allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings.
